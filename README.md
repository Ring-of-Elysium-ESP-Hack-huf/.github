## 🧠 What Is the ROE ESP Hack?

ESP stands for **Extra Sensory Perception**, and in the world of cheats, it means you see **everything**: players behind walls, traps on floors, loot in corners, and vehicles before they even rev their engine. The **ROE ESP Hack** injects directly into the game, overlaying this info on your screen in real time — without touching the game's core files.

Perfect for both casual players who want an edge and full-squad slayers looking to hunt nonstop.
